Hearing all these terms like "stock", "share", "index fund", "ETF", can have us confused like WTF? But I'm gonna break it down simply for you.

**Stock** is ownership. A **share** is a piece or unit of that ownership. Let's say Apple had only 100 shares of its stock, which means the ownership is split between 100 pieces. If you own ten shares of Apple stock, that means you own 10% of the company. That means of you are entitled to 10% of all the profit that Apple makes! There are other benefits for owning shares of a stock which I'll explain at another time.

When you hear of a "fund", think of it like a bucket that you can fill things (or in this case, companies) with. A **mutual fund** is bucket of companies and it is usually *actively* managed by a finance professional and charges a certain percentage to manage it. An **index fund** is similar to a mutual fund except it is *passively* managed, meaning a finance professional is not trying to buy or sell stock in the bucket. An example is Vanguard 500 Index ([VFIAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vfiax#portfolio-composition:~:text=weighted%20bond%20exposures.-,Holding%20details,-as%20of%2009 "VFIAX")) which is bucket containing the largest 500 companies in the United States (also known as the "S\&P 500"). When you buy a share of a fund, you really are getting small pieces of ownership of all the companies inside of that fund.

There is cost for managing a fund. When funds are actively managed (such as mutual funds), the cost is usually much higher compared to when funds are passively managed (such as index funds).

The very wealthy and popular investor, Warren Buffett, suggests how continually buying shares of an index fund for retirement "[makes most sense practically all of the time](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/12/warren-buffett-says-index-funds-make-the-best-retirement-sense-practically-all-the-time.html "makes most sense practically all of the time")" for a few reasons:

* You don't to spend time trying to pick the best companies since you are buying the bucket.
* Index funds (usually similar to the S\&P 500) have historically performed really well, most times even better than the finance professionals who manage mutual funds!
* You save so much money since the cost is cheaper because it is passively managed.

Warren believed in this idea so much that [he bet $1,000,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/03/billionaire-warren-buffett-swears-by-this-inexpensive-investing-strategy-that-anyone-can-try.html) (yes, one million dollars!) against active hedge fund managers by putting the money in the S\&P 500 index fund to see who would make the most money in a 10 year period. Warren won by a landslide, earned $854,000 while his competition earned only $220,000!

Finally, an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a fund where the shares can be traded throughout the day where as shares of a mutual fund or index fund can only be traded once a day.
