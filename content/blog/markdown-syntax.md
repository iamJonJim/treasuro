Here are the best budgeting software tools you can use!

### 1. [Mint.com](https://mint.intuit.com/)

This is free and automatically pulls the data from your accounts!

### 2. [EveryDollar](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/ramseyplus/everydollar)

This is from Dave Ramsey's team so you know you can trust it's built with your financial success in mind. There are two options, free or premium. The free version requires manually entering transactions which doesn't take long because the app makes it easy. The premium version is similar to Mint where your transactions are pulled automatically.

### 3. [Halfdollar](https://halfdollar.org/)

If you enjoy using Airtable or [spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17wqCL8NLsgysQybjEajpqzm1nXz6jCqm2PlxCJWsvjY/copy), this option is just for you! Also, it is completely free!
